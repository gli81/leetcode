# LeetCode Works

This repository contains all leetcode problems I completed (attempted). I love data structure and algorithm questions and I solve leetcode problems as a hobby.

## Resources

Some resources I use:
- [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io)
- [leetcode.wang (Chinese)](https://leetcode.wang)
- Solutions in LeetCode Solution ([China version LeetCode](leetcode.cn) provides offical solution, while global version doesn't)

Thank you to the creators for guiding people through the questions

## Language

Programming languages I am familiar with:
- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-%233776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=%23ffffff): I started programming in Python in May, 2019. Problems solved with version 3.9.13

## Scripts
- node_structure/*: contains data structures like `ListNode`, `TreeNode`, `TrieNode`. Provides basic functionality used in relevant LeetCode questions, and format printing. **[20241123 - Need to work on C++ TrieNode to make sure memory deallocated properly]**

- javarun.bat & javarun : bat and bash scripts to compile and run java source files with Node files in one go (solving the issue brought by the fact that all question source files are inside a folder starting with the question number).
- push.bat: bat script that push to github in one go.
